# Hello, I'm Foster Nilsson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated data engineer passionate about designing and building efficient data pipelines. My focus is on automating processes to enhance business efficiency and maximize data utilization. I have expertise in various data engineering tools, including:

- **Pandas** - for data manipulation and analysis.
- **PySpark** - for processing large-scale data.
- **PostgreSQL** - for robust data management.
- **AWS Lambda** - for running serverless computing.
- **Cloud Solutions** - for scalable and flexible infrastructure.

I'm currently deepening my knowledge in Linux, particularly Ubuntu 22.04, to manage lightweight Docker containers. These containers are designed to collaborate effectively, processing data and driving results efficiently.

In addition, I'm very interested in expanding my expertise into advanced data warehousing solutions like Snowflake and exploring cutting-edge analytical tools like Databricks. My goal is to leverage these technologies to further enhance data-driven decision-making processes.
