# Hello, I'm Foster Nilsson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated data engineer passionate about designing and building efficient data pipelines. My focus is on automating processes to enhance business efficiency and maximize data utilization. I have expertise in various data engineering tools, including:

- **Pandas** - for data manipulation and analysis.
- **PySpark** - for processing large-scale data.
- **PostgreSQL** - for robust data management.
- **AWS Lambda** - for running serverless computing.
- **Cloud Solutions** - for scalable and flexible infrastructure.

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in Linux, particularly Ubuntu 22.04, to manage lightweight Docker containers. These containers are designed to collaborate effectively, processing data and driving results efficiently.
