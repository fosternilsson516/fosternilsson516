# Hello, I'm Foster Nilsson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated data engineer passionate about designing and building efficient data pipelines. My focus is on creating actionable business insighs from unwieldy data. I have proficient in various data engineering tools, including:

- **Pandas** - for data manipulation and analysis.
- **PySpark** - for processing large-scale data.
- **SQL/Snowflake** - for robust data management.
- **AWS Lambda, EC2, S3** - for general cloud computing.
- **Terraform** - to define, provision, and manage infrastructure as code.

I'm currently deepening my knowledge in Linux(particularly Ubuntu 22.04) orchestrating lightweight Docker containers. My passion lies in harnessing the power of data to drive informed decision-making. I believe data is the cornerstone of effective strategies, and I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge of cutting-edge technologies. I'm particularly interested in gaining hands-on experience with Databricks, recognizing its potential to unlock deeper insights and facilitate more impactful data-driven solutions.
